## Welcome to GitHub Training

You'll use this repo with Wheelhouse's GitHub training. When you're asked questions about a repository, this is where you'll find the answers. In addition, during the labs you can make changes directly on this repository and the changes will be reflected on Wheelhouse once they've been performed correctly. This way you get feedback about the work you've done.

We've also included instructions for the labs here, so if you're ever stuck during one you can take a look at the files in the "instructions" folder.
